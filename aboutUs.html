          <h1>Satoshi Nakamoto</h1>
          <h3>Inventor of Blockchain/Bitcoin</h3>
           <p>Satoshi played video games his whole life growing up. And noticed how games got more expensive overtime especially during the 08 market crash.<br>
            That's when he decided to do something about the monetary system. He took a coding bootcamp and made his own videogame money called Bitcoin. <br>
            Now he wants you to be able to buy as many videogames as you want without suffering from market inflation. You can now buy Bitcoin from him<br>
            on his site! Welcome to the Metaverse!
